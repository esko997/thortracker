# Thor Tracker

A controller-first Android tracker for Game Boy / Game Boy Color music, designed around the AYN Thor's two displays. Projects use a versioned `.thor` document; export produces hUGETracker `.uge` v6 files.

Playback runs the actual pinned hUGEDriver 6.1.3 inside binjgb, through Android AAudio. There is no runtime compiler or separate approximate sequencer. The editor keeps the song in memory; new snapshots are prepared away from the audio callback and applied between driver ticks without restarting the song.

## Build and install

Requires JDK 17, Android SDK platform 35, build tools, NDK `27.0.12077973`, and CMake `3.22.1`. The Gradle wrapper uses Gradle 8.9.

```sh
./tools/build.sh
# APK: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb -s YOUR_DEVICE install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

`tools/build.sh` uses the host JDK when available, otherwise the workstation's `ubuntu` Distrobox. It serializes Gradle with the shared workstation build lock. A conventional environment can instead run `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug` with `ANDROID_HOME` set. Both arm64-v8a and x86_64 are included; Android 8 or later is required.

Generate a sample project and export:

```sh
./tools/build.sh exportSamples
# app/build/samples/thor-groove.thor
# app/build/samples/thor-groove.uge
```

The installed app opens **Thor Groove** on a first launch. Subsequent launches recover the working document. **File → New blank song** starts a new composition.

The verified delivery is `dist/thor-tracker-debug.apk`. `examples/` contains **Thor Groove** and **Controller Study**, each as `.thor` and `.uge`; the latter was entered through the running Thor UI and controller event path. See [verification results and remaining physical checks](docs/VERIFICATION.md) before treating measured engine latency as acoustic latency.

## Views and displays

Each display has one full-size view: **Pattern**, **Song**, **Instrument**, **Wave**, **Keyboard**, or **Help**. There is no designated “top-screen view” or “bottom-screen view.” Both displays can show the same kind of view and edit the same document. On a single-screen device, switch between views with the view button.

- **View button:** choose a view on that display. Choosing one pins it.
- **Pinned / Context button:** open behavior and layout options.
- **Pin:** prevent automatic changes of view kind.
- **Follow selected item:** follow the other view's published selection.
- **Lock to this item:** retain the current channel, instrument, or wave rather than following selection. Changing the kind of editor releases its old subject lock; swapping views preserves it.
- **Swap:** exchange complete view states, including cursor and scrolling.
- **Focus / R3:** choose which display receives controller input. Touch does not silently move controller focus. The focused view has an amber border and title marker.
- **Follow playhead:** optional in the pattern view; editing can stay at its cursor while playback continues elsewhere.

Preset layouts are Pattern + Keyboard and Pattern + Instrument. View layout, behavior and controller mappings persist between launches. Undo/redo belongs to the document, not the display.

The toolbar stays on one row. On the narrower display, **Swap**, **Undo/redo** and **File** remain available through **Menu** instead of taking space from the editor.

Native menus open on the display where the input was received, keeping their controller navigation local without changing the editor's logical controller focus.

Short cell and key afterglows, channel activity lamps, and focus/view transitions provide feedback without moving the grid or obscuring text. Animations settle completely when idle and honor Android's animator-duration setting, including disabled animations.

## Controller reference

Physical bindings are configurable through **Menu → Controller mappings**. On-screen hints and the Help view describe contextual controls.

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| D-pad | Move through fields, rows or tools |
| Hold A + D-pad | Change the selected value; horizontal fine, vertical coarse |
| Tap A | Enter the last note/value, or activate a command |
| Tap B | Clear the selected field; on an empty pattern note, place a cut |
| Hold B + D-pad | Move or jump without clearing on release |
| Hold X | Audition without writing |
| Hold Y + D-pad | Mark a pattern block |
| L1 / R1 | Change channel, instrument bank, wave or help page |
| L2 / R2 | Undo / redo |
| Select + X / A / B | Copy / paste / cut |
| Select + Y | Duplicate |
| Select + L1 / R1 | Lower / raise entry octave |
| Select + Up / Down | Insert / delete a row in the channel or selection |
| Start | Play / stop from the selected position |
| R3 | Switch controller focus between displays |
| Menu / Back | Application menu |

A held adjustment or wave-drawing gesture is one undo step. Overlapping gestures on the two displays share a step that commits after both end. Undo during a held controller adjustment ends that step; further changes start a new step. Undo during a touch drag ends its edits until the finger lifts. Touch drags keep their original instrument or wave, and selection/playhead following waits until the gesture ends. Opening a menu or leaving the app ends active gestures and releases audition notes. **Menu → Play from song start** explicitly starts at order 0, row 0; it is not a toggle.

### Enter a phrase

1. Choose Pattern. Navigate to a note field, hold A and use the D-pad to select a pitch. The adjacent sound field selects an instrument.
2. Tap A on subsequent empty rows to repeat the last note. **Menu → Entry step** sets the row advance.
3. Alternatively, put Keyboard on the other display, select **Write** with Y, and enter notes there. **Listen** mode auditions without changing the pattern.
4. Hold Y and move to mark a phrase; Select+X copies it, Select+A pastes it. L2 undoes a mistake.
5. Press Start to hear the phrase, edit while it plays, and stop/start or seek without saving or exporting.

The Song view edits arrangement, tempo, loop point and text, with repeat/new/clone/delete/move commands. Instrument edits affect later note triggers. The Wave view edits the 32 four-bit samples directly; held drawing and touch drags are grouped for undo.

The keyboard's base octave is limited to 7. Keys above B-8 are dark and unavailable rather than silently clamped to another pitch.

## Sound and export rules

The first backend is explicitly **GB/hUGE**: two pulse channels, one wave channel and one noise channel; 64 rows per pattern; one effect per channel per row. There are 15 instrument slots in each pulse/wave/noise bank and 16 wave tables. Instrument 0 means **legato**: it does not retrigger or reload an instrument. A legato note after a cut can therefore remain silent.

- Pattern edits are heard from the next row; updates do not restart transport.
- Instrument changes apply on the next note that loads that instrument. A sustained note keeps its existing envelope/settings.
- Wave edits reload on the next wave-channel note with an instrument.
- The base tempo can change while playing.
- Audition temporarily borrows the selected channel; the other song channels continue. The borrowed song channel resumes at its next note after audition release.
- Seeking reconstructs driver state by silently running earlier rows. Extremely long or unreachable positions use a fresh state at the requested order's beginning; see the audio document for the exact bound.

**Help → Check** lists export errors and warnings. The app will not silently export unsupported driver routines or broken noise pitch effects. An unfinished, export-invalid song can still be saved as a project. If a live edit cannot be lowered, playback retains the last valid snapshot and reports the problem.

Export is `.uge` only. GB-specific editing semantics live in the backend; future backends can define different channels, instruments and editors without pretending that GB songs convert losslessly to other chips.

## Saving and recovery

**File → Save / Save as / Open / Export .uge** uses Android's document picker and user-selected locations; no broad storage permission is requested.

- Working changes are automatically written to an app-private, atomically replaced recovery file after a short debounce and when the activity pauses.
- Replacing a document retains one previous-project recovery backup. A later replacement overwrites that single slot: use named project files for permanent versions.
- Unreadable recovery files are quarantined intact rather than replaced in place. The app reports the failure and retained location.
- Opening a project validates its version and structure before replacing the working document.
- Recovery writes use a separate queue from document-provider I/O, so a stalled external save cannot block recovery of newer edits. Both run off the UI thread.
- Saving captures the version selected for that operation. If editing continues, the app reports that newer edits remain unsaved. Completing an older save cannot attach its destination to a different document.
- Android document providers control the durability and atomicity of writes to their own destinations; the app-private recovery copy remains separate.

Undo/redo is session history, not part of the serialized project format. App-private recovery is not a substitute for external backups; uninstalling or clearing app storage removes it.

## Verification commands

```sh
./tools/build.sh testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug assembleDebugAndroidTest exportSamples
./tools/audio/run_native_host_test.sh
adb -s YOUR_TEST_DEVICE install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb -s YOUR_TEST_DEVICE install -r app/build/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/app-debug-androidTest.apk
adb -s YOUR_TEST_DEVICE shell am instrument -w org.thortracker.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner
```

Only run device checks on a device reserved for the test; the controller workflow test edits the app's working document. Host playback checks produce a WAV and driver trace under `evidence/audio/`. The sample `.uge` has also been converted with gbc-puzzler's pinned `uge2source`, built into an isolated copy of the game and exercised by its actual-ROM sound smoke; the original game worktree is not modified.
